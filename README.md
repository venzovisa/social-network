# Social Network

This project is the final step of my participation in [Telerik Academy Alpha JavaScript Track](https://www.telerikacademy.com/alpha/javascript) in 2021. It has server part which is provided by the academy and the client part that is implemented by me. The application has a standard feed, users, friends and notifications features implemented on React and context API. There is a prefilled database with some data that could be acccessed out of the box. For the backend part please refer to the server folder [readme file](https://github.com/venzovisa/social-network/tree/main/server).
